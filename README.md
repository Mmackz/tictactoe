### About the project

This project is part of the FullStack JavaScript module on The Odin Project. This is meant to showcase the knowledge we have learned in this section, 
and implement this simple game using factory functions and the module pattern. The game can be played versus a human or a computer opponent.
The computer opponent uses the minimax algorithm to choose the best move, so it will be unbeatable on hard difficulty. On easy mode it has a large probability
to make early mistakes, and a slight chance to make mistakes later in the game.
